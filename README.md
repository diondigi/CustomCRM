# CustomCRM
***2018.2.10*** The function of the practice, the custom of django admin function, packaging and upload, as a step of learning. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. If ten years is the time to do one thing, it should be successful, right?

The project structure and comments are updated.

>My experience on this long journey is that programming languages are not important, and what matters is what you do with them. In fact, I always knew that, but I used to be distracted by programming languages periodically. Now I will never forget it, and you should not forget it.

>The last thing I want to say is that learning to create software will change you and make you different. Not better or worse, just different. You may find that because you can write software and people have a weird attitude towards you, you might use the word "geek" to describe you. Maybe you'll find that because you're going to poke through their logic holes and they start to hate to argue with you. You might even find someone who thinks you're a nerd because you know how a computer works.


>There is only one suggestion for me: let them die. The world needs more geeks, who know how things work and like to find answers. When they do that to you, just remember that this is your journey, not theirs. "Being different" is not the fault of anyone who tells you that "being different is a mistake" is just jealous of your skills that they can't even dream of.


>You can program. They don't. This is fucking cool.
